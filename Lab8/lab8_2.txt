A:
 i. For a UI to be "composable" means that you can return a tree of elements. This is highly useful
    in maintaining a webpage because if you change one part of the tree, that doesn't mean you have
    to change the entire thing.

 ii. JSX is used to "render" components that are made using React. It is not required though, so
     you can just us JavaScript.

 iii. The data is first loaded by the server from the comments.js file. Data can then be created
      based on what the user of the site enters and React's system of components and saved into
      the comments.js file once the user has submited the information.

 iv. Being immutable means that once a component renders itself it is "owned by the parent" and, 
     for the most part, can't be changed. To be able to interact with a component it needs to be
     mutable which is why we use this.setState

B:
 i. I you change the comments.js file and save it the webpage will update without needing the
    webpage to refresh. I think this happens because the server is keeping a constant eye on
    the state of the file and will keep loading what is there.

 ii. React will only render components once, so it needs to load everything in before it will render
     and be visable to the user

 iii. An outdated state of view could lead to false/bad information

 iv. It does seem foolish to just accept any comment that is generated. I'm pretty sure if the server
     doesn't accept a comment the entire system shuts down.
