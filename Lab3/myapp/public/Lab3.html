                 <ul>
                 <li>a. Node is used as a platform for JavaScript in the server while
	         Express is used as a framework for Node for making a web 
                 application.</li>
                 <li>b. The purpose of the package.json file is to provide a bunch of
                 data for node so that a server can run a JavaScript program.</li>
                 </ul>
                 <li>3.2:</li>
                 <ul>
                 <li>a. These files are static because there is sort of nothing to do
                 with the file. It's just brought up and placed into the browser
                 and that's it.</li>
                 <li>b. The server will not serve the hello world message because bringing
                 up an image, using an html file, or something of the like will take 
                 precidance over serving the message.</li>
                 </ul>
              </ul>
